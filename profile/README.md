## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a shepherd, I tend sheep, I live in the mountains, I cut wood, I make my own furniture, I grow my own crops, I herd my own cattle, I cook my own food, I earn my own bread and yet how dependent i am on allah.(for the non-muslims ;) Allah = God)

I never thought technology was mainstream, Yes everyone else does. I just see technology as enablement of human potential. Without mining coal, Humans could have never dreamt of instagram!
Technology is a tool for liberation and non-partial equity. 

When I'm not optimizing containers or architecting distributed systems, I'm likely auditing code for security or helping a student spin up their first VM.

## ⚖️ My Principles

I operate by a strict set of core values that guide every line of code I write and every project I undertake:

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Community-First** | Systems should be built *by* and *for* the people who use them. Decisions are made with the collective interest in mind. |
| **Accessibility** | Powerful tools should not be gated by wealth. If you want to make money, collect a one-time payment and move on |
| **Innovation** | Stagnation is a security risk. I believe if today, you don't do it. Then tommorow someone else will  |
| **Trust & Security** | In a P2P world, trust is currency. Creating secure environments is my top priority. |

## 👻 Why I Don't Have a Digital Footprint

You might notice a lack of social media links or a sparse public history outside of GitHub. This is intentional. 

**I believe that privacy is a fundamental human right.** In an age of surveillance capitalism, I choose to minimize my data exhaust. My identity is defined by my contributions, my commits, and the code I ship, not by a curated social media feed. I prefer my work to speak for itself, unencumbered by the noise of the digital attention economy.

## 🗣️ My Opinions

> "The cloud is just someone else's computer. It's time we made it *everyone's* computer."

* **On Education:** Financial barriers should never stop a curious mind from learning to code or deploy a server.
* **On Centralization:** The internet was designed to be decentralized. We need to return to those roots to ensure resilience and freedom.
* **On Open Source:** It is not just a license; it is a moral imperative for critical infrastructure.

## 🌐 What is Freedesk?

Freedesk is the manifestation of my principles in code. It is a **community-driven platform that provides free, peer-to-peer virtual machines.**

We are on a mission to democratize access to cloud computing resources for education and learning. By harnessing the collective power of the community's unused computing resources, we create a revolutionary P2P network that is:

* **Resilient:** No single point of failure.
* **Scalable:** Grows as the community grows.
* **Cost-Effective:** Removing the massive overhead of traditional data centers.

### 🤝 Powered by Partners & Community
We stand on the shoulders of giants and the hard work of contributors.
* **Partners:** Coolify, Microsoft, Fastly, Vultr, Action1.
* **Contributors:** A massive thanks to the dozens of developers who have pushed commits to make this reality.
